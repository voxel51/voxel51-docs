# Datasets and Models with FiftyOne

This page introduces the section. Talks about how to bring in data and models in general but then also refers to some of the suggested ways to do it like zoos, hugging face, integrations...

## Datasets
Our [conceptual documentation](../fiftyone_concepts/dataset_creation/index.md) on Datasets covers many different ways to bring your data into FiftyOne, it is a good idea to undestand those concepts before you go any further with bringing in data. 


## Models

We need a discussion on the different ways to work with models in FiftyOne - from zoo, to integrations, to use your own but then add the Label you want back to your data
