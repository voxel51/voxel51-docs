# FiftyOne Teams [¶](\#fiftyone-teams "Permalink to this headline")

[FiftyOne Teams](https://voxel51.com/fiftyone-teams/) enables multiple users
to securely collaborate on the same datasets and models, either on-premises or
in the cloud, all built on top of the open source FiftyOne workflows that
you’re already relying on.

FiftyOne Teams is fully backwards-compatible with the
[open source project](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone), so all other
pages on this site apply to Teams deployments as well.
