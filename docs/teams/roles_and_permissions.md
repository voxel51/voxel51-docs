# Roles and permissions [¶](\#roles-and-permissions "Permalink to this headline")

FiftyOne Teams is built for collaboration, with the goal of making it as easy
as possible for engineers, data scientists, and stakeholders to work together
to build high quality datasets and computer vision models.

Accordingly, FiftyOne Teams gives you the flexibility to configure user roles,
user groups and fine-grained permissions so that you can safely and securely
collaborate both inside and outside your organization at all stages of your
workflows.

This page introduces the basic roles and permissions available in
FiftyOne Teams.

## Roles [¶](\#roles "Permalink to this headline")

FiftyOne Teams has four user roles: Admin, Member, Collaborator, and Guest.

Admins can access user management features by clicking on their account icon in
the upper-right of the FiftyOne Teams App and navigating to the
“Settings > Team > Users” page:

![admin-team-users-page](../_images/admin_team_users_page.webp)

Admins can invite new users by clicking on “Invite people”, as shown below.
Invited users will receive an email invitation with a link to accept the
invitation.

Note

Invited users may login using any identity provider that has been enabled on your
deployment. If you need more information about configuring IdPs or increasing
your user quotas, contact your Voxel51 CS engineer.

### Admin [¶](\#admin "Permalink to this headline")

Admins have full access to all of an organization’s datasets and can
create, edit, and delete any dataset.

Admins can also invite or remove users from the organization and change any
other user’s roles, including promoting/demoting users to admins.

### Member [¶](\#member "Permalink to this headline")

Members can create new datasets and can be granted any desired level of
permission on existing datasets. Members may also have a
[default access level](#teams-default-access) to datasets that use this
feature.

Members do not have the ability to see or manage an organization’s users.

### Collaborator [¶](\#collaborator "Permalink to this headline")

Collaborators only have access to datasets to which they have been specifically
granted access (a dataset’s
[default access level](#teams-default-access) does not apply to
Collaborators), and they may only be granted **Can view**, **Can tag**
or **Can edit** access to datasets.

Collaborators cannot create new datasets, clone existing datasets, or view
other users of the deployment. Collaborators may export datasets to which
they’ve been granted access.

### Guest [¶](\#guest "Permalink to this headline")

Guests only have access to datasets to which they have been specifically
granted access (a dataset’s
[default access level](#teams-default-access) does not apply to Guests),
and they may only be granted **Can view** access to datasets.

Guests cannot create new datasets, clone existing datasets, export datasets, or
view other users of the deployment.

### Groups [¶](\#groups "Permalink to this headline")

User groups in FiftyOne Teams allow organization admins to manage a collection
of users as a single entity. This simplifies the process of assigning
permissions to multiple users, making it more efficient to control access to
datasets.

Admins can manage groups through the “Settings > Team > Groups” page.
Each group can be given specific dataset access permissions, which apply to
all users within the group. Collaborators’ and guests’ access to the dataset is
limited by the maximum dataset access level of the role.

![admin-team-groups-page](../_images/admin_team_groups_page.webp)

Admins can create a new group by clicking on “Create group” and then adding
existing users to the group by clicking on “Add users”.

![admin-create-group](../_images/admin_create_group.webp)![admin-team-add-users-to-team](../_images/admin_add_users_to_team.webp)

Note

Non-existing users cannot be directly added to a group. Users must be
invited and accept the invitation before they can be added to a group.

## Permissions [¶](\#permissions "Permalink to this headline")

Admins and users with the **Can manage** permission on a dataset can configure
a dataset’s permissions under the dataset’s
[Manage tab](teams_app.md#teams-managing-datasets) in the FiftyOne Teams App.

In FiftyOne Teams, dataset permissions for a user are determined by both the
access they receive from their groups’ permissions and individual permissions
assigned to them.

A user’s permissions on a dataset is the maximum of their permissions from the
following sources:

- Admins implicitly have full access to all datasets

- Members have the dataset’s
[default access level](#teams-default-access)

- Users may be granted [specific access](#teams-specific-access) to the
dataset

- Users may be members of one or more groups, each of which may have
[specific access](#teams-specific-access) to the dataset


Note

User role determines the highest level of access that a user can be granted
to a dataset. For example, a user with Guest role can be added to a group
with **Can edit** permission to a dataset, but this user will have
**Can view** permission instead of **Can edit** permission of the dataset,
because Guest role only allows **Can view** permission to datasets.

### Default access [¶](\#default-access "Permalink to this headline")

All datasets have a default access level, which defines a minimum permission
level that all Members have on the dataset.

A dataset’s default access level can be set to **No access**, **Can view**,
**Can tag**, **Can edit**, or **Can manage** as shown below:

![default-access](../_images/dataset_default_access.webp)

Note

Default access level only applies to Members. Guests and Collaborators must
be granted [specific access](#teams-specific-access) to datasets.

### Specific access [¶](\#specific-access "Permalink to this headline")

Authorized users can grant specific access to a dataset using the “People and
groups with access” section shown below.

To give access to an existing user or group, simply click “Share” button on
the top right. A list of users with access to the dataset is shown. Click
“Add User” or “Add Group” to grant access to a new user or group.

![specific-access](../_images/share_dataset.webp)![specific-access](../_images/dataset_specific_access.webp)

The following permissions are available to each user role:

- Groups may be granted **Can view**, **Can tag**, **Can edit**,
or **Can manage** permissions

- Members may be granted **Can view**, **Can tag**, **Can edit**,
or **Can manage** permissions

- Collaborators may be granted **Can view**, **Can tag**,
or **Can edit** permissions

- Guests may be granted **Can view** permissions


Note

Authorized users can use the “Grant access” workflow to give **Can view**
, **Can tag**, or **Can edit** access to a dataset to an email address that
is not yet user of a FiftyOne Teams deployment.

When the invitation is accepted, the user will become a Guest if the
**Can view** permission is chosen or a Collaborator if a higher permission
is chosen, and an Admin can upgrade this user to another role if desired via
the Team Settings page.

### No access [¶](\#no-access "Permalink to this headline")

If a user has no access to a dataset, the dataset will not appear in the user’s
search results or show on their dataset listing page. Any direct links to this
dataset that the user attempts to open will show a 404 page.

### Can view [¶](\#can-view "Permalink to this headline")

A user with **Can view** permissions on a dataset can find the dataset from
their dataset listing page.

Users with **Can view** permissions cannot modify the dataset in any way, for
example by adding or removing samples, tags, annotation runs, brain runs, etc.

Note

Members (but not Guests or Collaborators) with **Can view** access to a
dataset may clone the dataset.

### Can tag [¶](\#can-tag "Permalink to this headline")

A user with **Can tag** permissions on a dataset can find the dataset from
their dataset listing page.

Users with **Can tag** permissions can modify sample/label tags but cannot
modify the dataset in any other way.

### Can edit [¶](\#can-edit "Permalink to this headline")

A user with **Can edit** permissions on a dataset has all permissions from
**Can view** and, in addition, can modify the dataset, including:

- Adding, editing, and deleting samples

- Adding, editing, and deleting tags

- Adding and deleting annotation runs, brain runs, etc.


Note

Deleting a dataset requires the **Can manage** permission.

### Can manage [¶](\#can-manage "Permalink to this headline")

A user with **Can manage** permissions on a dataset has all permissions from
**Can view**, **Can tag** and **Can edit** and, in addition, can delete the
dataset and configure the permissions on the dataset of other users.

Remember that all admins can implicitly access and manage all datasets created
on your team’s deployment.

Note

Any member who creates a dataset (including cloning an existing dataset or
view) will be granted **Can manage** permissions on the new dataset.

## Roles page [¶](\#roles-page "Permalink to this headline")

Admins can review the actions and permissions available to each user role by
navigating to the “Settings > Security > Roles” page:
