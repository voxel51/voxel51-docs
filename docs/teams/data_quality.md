# Data Quality [¶](\#data-quality "Permalink to this headline")

**Available in FiftyOne Teams v2.2+**

The Data Quality panel is a builtin feature of the
[FiftyOne Teams App](teams_app.md#teams-app) that automatically scans your dataset
for common quality issues and helps you explore and take action to resolve
them.

## Data Quality panel [¶](\#data-quality-panel "Permalink to this headline")

You can open the Data Quality panel by clicking the “+” icon next to the
Samples tab.

The panel’s home page shows a list of the available issue types and their
current analysis/review status:

- **Brightness**: scans for images that are unusually bright or dim

- **Blurriness**: scans for images that are abnormally blurry or sharp

- **Aspect Ratio**: scans for images that have extreme aspect ratios

- **Entropy**: scans for images that have unusually small or large entropy

- **Near Duplicates**: leverages embeddings to scan for
[near-duplicate samples](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-near-duplicates) in your dataset

- **Exact Duplicates**: uses filehashes to scan your dataset for duplicate
data with either the same or different filenames


Click on the right arrow of an issue type’s card to open its expanded view.

## Scanning for issues [¶](\#scanning-for-issues "Permalink to this headline")

If you have not yet scanned a dataset for a given issue type, you’ll see a
landing page like this:

![data-quality-brightness-scan](../_images/data_quality_brightness_scan.webp)

Clicking the “Scan Dataset” button presents two choices for execution:

![data-quality-brightness-scan-options](../_images/data_quality_brightness_scan_options.webp)

Note

The “Execute” option is **only for testing**. In this mode, computation is
performend synchronously and will timeout if it does not complete within a
few minutes.

Choose “Schedule” for all production data, which schedules the scan for
[delegated execution](teams_plugins.md#teams-delegated-operations) on your compute
cluster.

While a scan is in-progress, you’ll see a status page like this:

![data-quality-brightness-scheduled](../_images/data_quality_brightness_scheduled.webp)

Click the link in the notification to navigate to the dataset’s
[Runs page](teams_plugins.md#teams-managing-delegated-operations) where you can monitor
the status of the task.

## Analyzing scan results [¶](\#analyzing-scan-results "Permalink to this headline")

Once an issue scan is complete, its card will update to display an interactive
histogram that you can use to analyze the findings:

![data-quality-brightness-analysis](../_images/data_quality_brightness_analysis.webp)

Note

When analyzing issue scan results, we recommend using the split screen icon
to the right of the Samples panel tab to arrange the Samples panel and Data
Quality panel side-by-side, as shown above.

Each issue type’s results are stored under a dedicated field of the dataset,
from which the displayed histograms are generated:

- **Brightness**: the brightness of each image is stored in a `brightness`
field of the sample

- **Blurriness**: the blurriness of each image is stored in a `blurriness`
field of the sample

- **Aspect Ratio**: the aspect ratio of each image is stored in an
`aspect_ratio` field of the sample

- **Entropy**: the entropy of each image is stored in an `entropy` field of
the sample

- **Near Duplicates**: the nearest neighbor distance of each sample is stored
in a `nearest_neighbor` field of the sample

- **Exact Duplicates**: the filehash of each image is stored in a `filehash`
field of the sample


Each issue type comes with a default threshold range that highlights potential
issues in your dataset. If issues are identified, the number of potential
issues will be displayed in the top-left corner of the Data Quality panel and
the Samples panel will automatically update to show the corresponding samples
in the grid.

You can also use the threshold slider to manually explore different threshold
ranges. When you release the slider, the Samples panel will automatically
update to show the corresponding samples:

![data-quality-brightness-slider](../_images/data_quality_brightness_slider.webp)

If you find a better threshold for a dataset, you can save it via the
“Save Threshold” option under the settings menu. You can use
“Reset Threshold” to the revert to the default threshold at any time.

Once you’ve reviewed the potential issues in the grid, you can use the
“Add Tags” button to take action on them. Clicking the button will display a
modal like this:

![data-quality-brightness-tag](../_images/data_quality_brightness_tag.webp)

Note

If you’ve selected samples in the grid, only those samples will be tagged.
Otherwise, tags will be added to all samples in your current view (i.e.,
all potential issues).

You can use the “sample tags” filter in the
[App’s sidebar](../fiftyone_concepts/app.md#app-fields-sidebar) to retrieve, review, and act on all
samples that you’ve previously tagged.

The review status indicator in the top-right corner of the panel indicates
whether an issue type is currently “In Review” or “Reviewed”. You can click on
it at any time to toggle the review status.

If you navigate away from an issue type that is currently “In Review”, you’ll
be prompted to indicate whether or not you’d like to mark the issue type as
“Reviewed”:

![data-quality-brightness-mark-as-reviewed](../_images/data_quality_brightness_mark_as_reviewed.webp)

## Updating a scan [¶](\#updating-a-scan "Permalink to this headline")

The Data Quality panel gracefully adapts to changes in your datasets after
scans have been performed.

If you delete samples from a dataset, the
[histograms](#data-quality-analyze) of any existing scans will
automatically be updated to reflect the new distribution.

If you add new samples to a dataset or clear some existing field values
associated with a scan (e.g., `brightness` field values for brightness scans),
the panel will automatically detect the presence of unscanned samples and will
display contextual information from the [home page](#data-quality-home)
and [analysis page](#data-quality-analyze):

![data-quality-new-samples-home](../_images/data_quality_new_samples_home.webp)

To update an existing scan, open the issue type and click the
“Scan New Samples” button in the bottom-right corner of the
[analysis page](#data-quality-analyze). This will open a modal that
provides additional context and prompts you to initiate the new samples scan:

![data-quality-new-samples-modal](../_images/data_quality_new_samples_modal.webp)

## Deleting a scan [¶](\#deleting-a-scan "Permalink to this headline")

You can delete an issue scan by simply deleting the corresponding field from
the dataset (e.g., `brightness` for brightness scans).

Note

Did you know? You can delete sample fields from the App using the
`delete_sample_field` operator available via the
[Operator browser](../plugins/using_plugins.md#using-operators).
