# Teams Management SDK [¶](\#teams-management-sdk "Permalink to this headline")

One of FiftyOne’s core design principles is that you should be able to do
everything _programmatically_ if you want.

To this end, the `fiftyone.management` module provides Teams-specific methods
for managing users, invitations, dataset permissions, plugins, API keys, and
more.

Note

You must use an [API connection](api_connection.md#teams-api-connection) (not a direct
MongoDB connection) in order to use Management SDK methods.
