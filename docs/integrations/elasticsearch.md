# Elasticsearch Vector Search Integration [¶](\#elasticsearch-vector-search-integration "Permalink to this headline")

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search/vector-search) is
one of the most popular search platforms available, and we’ve made it easy to
use Elasticsearch’s vector search capabilities on your computer vision data
directly from FiftyOne!

Follow these [simple instructions](#elasticsearch-setup) to get started
using Elasticsearch + FiftyOne.

FiftyOne provides an API to create Elasticsearch indexes, upload vectors, and
run similarity queries, both [programmatically](#elasticsearch-query) in
Python and via point-and-click in the App.

Note

Did you know? You can
[search by natural language](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-similarity-text) using
Elasticsearch similarity indexes!

## Basic recipe [¶](\#basic-recipe "Permalink to this headline")

The basic workflow to use Elasticsearch to create a similarity index on your
FiftyOne datasets and use this to query your data is as follows:

1. Connect to or start an Elasticsearch server

2. Load a [dataset](../fiftyone_concepts/dataset_creation/index.md#loading-datasets) into FiftyOne

3. Compute embedding vectors for samples or patches in your dataset, or select
a model to use to generate embeddings

4. Use the `compute_similarity()`
method to generate a Elasticsearch similarity index for the samples or
object patches in a dataset by setting the parameter
`backend="elasticsearch"` and specifying a `brain_key` of your choice

5. Use this Elasticsearch similarity index to query your data with
[`sort_by_similarity()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity")

6. If desired, delete the index


The example below demonstrates this workflow.

Note

You must have access to
[an Elasticsearch server](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)
and install the
[Elasticsearch Python client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html)
to run this example:

```python
pip install elasticsearch

```

Note that, if you are using a custom Elasticsearch server, you can store
your credentials as described in [this section](#elasticsearch-setup)
to avoid entering them manually each time you interact with your
Elasticsearch index.

First let’s load a dataset into FiftyOne and compute embeddings for the samples:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

# Step 1: Load your data into FiftyOne
dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

# Steps 2 and 3: Compute embeddings and create a similarity index
elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
)

```

Once the similarity index has been generated, we can query our data in FiftyOne
by specifying the `brain_key`:

```python
# Step 4: Query your data
query = dataset.first().id  # query by sample ID
view = dataset.sort_by_similarity(
    query,
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    k=10,  # limit to 10 most similar samples
)

# Step 5 (optional): Cleanup

# Delete the Elasticsearch index
elasticsearch_index.cleanup()

# Delete run record from FiftyOne
dataset.delete_brain_run("elasticsearch_index")

```

Note

Skip to [this section](#elasticsearch-examples) for a variety of
common Elasticsearch query patterns.

## Setup [¶](\#setup "Permalink to this headline")

The easiest way to get started with Elasticsearch is to
[install locally via Docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html#run-elasticsearch).

### Installing the Elasticsearch client [¶](\#installing-the-elasticsearch-client "Permalink to this headline")

In order to use the Elasticsearch backend, you must also install the
[Elasticsearch Python client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/getting-started-python.html):

```python
pip install elasticsearch

```

### Using the Elasticsearch backend [¶](\#using-the-elasticsearch-backend "Permalink to this headline")

By default, calling
`compute_similarity()` or
[`sort_by_similarity()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity")
will use an sklearn backend.

To use the Elasticsearch backend, simply set the optional `backend` parameter of
`compute_similarity()` to
`"elasticsearch"`:

```python
import fiftyone.brain as fob

fob.compute_similarity(..., backend="elasticsearch", ...)

```

Alternatively, you can permanently configure FiftyOne to use the Elasticsearch
backend by setting the following environment variable:

```python
export FIFTYONE_BRAIN_DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_BACKEND=elasticsearch

```

or by setting the `default_similarity_backend` parameter of your
[brain config](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-config) located at `~/.fiftyone/brain_config.json`:

```python
{
    "default_similarity_backend": "elasticsearch"
}

```

### Authentication [¶](\#authentication "Permalink to this headline")

If you are using a custom Elasticsearch server, you can provide your
credentials in a
[variety of ways](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/connecting.html#connecting).

**Environment variables (recommended)**

The recommended way to configure your Elasticsearch credentials is to store
them in the environment variables shown below, which are automatically accessed
by FiftyOne whenever a connection to Elasticsearch is made.

```python
export FIFTYONE_BRAIN_SIMILARITY_ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://localhost:9200
export FIFTYONE_BRAIN_SIMILARITY_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=XXXXXXXX
export FIFTYONE_BRAIN_SIMILARITY_ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXX

```

This is only one example of variables that can be used to authenticate an
Elasticsearch client. Find more information
[here.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/connecting.html#connecting)

**FiftyOne Brain config**

You can also store your credentials in your [brain config](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-config)
located at `~/.fiftyone/brain_config.json`:

```python
{
    "similarity_backends": {
        "elasticsearch": {
            "hosts": "http://localhost:9200",
            "username": "XXXXXXXX",
            "password": "XXXXXXXX"
        }
    }
}

```

Note that this file will not exist until you create it.

**Keyword arguments**

You can manually provide credentials as keyword arguments each time you call
methods like `compute_similarity()`
that require connections to Elasticsearch:

```python
import fiftyone.brain as fob

elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    ...
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    hosts="http://localhost:9200",
    username="XXXXXXXX",
    password="XXXXXXXX",
)

```

Note that, when using this strategy, you must manually provide the credentials
when loading an index later via
[`load_brain_results()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_brain_results "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_brain_results"):

```python
elasticsearch_index = dataset.load_brain_results(
    "elasticsearch_index",
    hosts="http://localhost:9200",
    username="XXXXXXXX",
    password="XXXXXXXX",
)

```

### Elasticsearch config parameters [¶](\#elasticsearch-config-parameters "Permalink to this headline")

The Elasticsearch backend supports a variety of query parameters that can be
used to customize your similarity queries. These parameters include:

- **index\_name** ( _None_): the name of the Elasticsearch vector search index
to use or create. If not specified, a new unique name is generated automatically

- **metric** ( _“cosine”_): the distance/similarity metric to use when
creating a new index. The supported values are
`("cosine", "dotproduct", "euclidean", "innerproduct")`


For detailed information on these parameters, see the
[Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dense-vector.html#dense-vector-similarity).

You can specify these parameters via any of the strategies described in the
previous section. Here’s an example of a [brain config](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-config)
that includes all of the available parameters:

```python
{
    "similarity_backends": {
        "elasticsearch": {
            "index_name": "your-index",
            "metric": "cosine"
        }
    }
}

```

However, typically these parameters are directly passed to
`compute_similarity()` to configure
a specific new index:

```python
elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    ...
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    index_name="your-index",
    metric="cosine",
)

```

## Managing brain runs [¶](\#managing-brain-runs "Permalink to this headline")

FiftyOne provides a variety of methods that you can use to manage brain runs.

For example, you can call
[`list_brain_runs()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_brain_runs "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_brain_runs")
to see the available brain keys on a dataset:

```python
import fiftyone.brain as fob

# List all brain runs
dataset.list_brain_runs()

# Only list similarity runs
dataset.list_brain_runs(type=fob.Similarity)

# Only list specific similarity runs
dataset.list_brain_runs(
    type=fob.Similarity,
    patches_field="ground_truth",
    supports_prompts=True,
)

```

Or, you can use
[`get_brain_info()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_brain_info "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_brain_info")
to retrieve information about the configuration of a brain run:

```python
info = dataset.get_brain_info(brain_key)
print(info)

```

Use [`load_brain_results()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_brain_results "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_brain_results")
to load the `SimilarityIndex` instance for a brain run.

You can use
[`rename_brain_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_brain_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_brain_run")
to rename the brain key associated with an existing similarity results run:

```python
dataset.rename_brain_run(brain_key, new_brain_key)

```

Finally, you can use
[`delete_brain_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_brain_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_brain_run")
to delete the record of a similarity index computation from your FiftyOne
dataset:

```python
dataset.delete_brain_run(brain_key)

```

Note

Calling
[`delete_brain_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_brain_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_brain_run")
only deletes the **record** of the brain run from your FiftyOne dataset; it
will not delete any associated Elasticsearch index, which you can do as
follows:

```python
# Delete the Elasticsearch index
elasticsearch_index = dataset.load_brain_results(brain_key)
elasticsearch_index.cleanup()

```

## Examples [¶](\#examples "Permalink to this headline")

This section demonstrates how to perform some common vector search workflows on
a FiftyOne dataset using the Elasticsearch backend.

Note

All of the examples below assume you have configured your Elasticsearch
server as described in [this section](#elasticsearch-setup).

### Create a similarity index [¶](\#create-a-similarity-index "Permalink to this headline")

In order to create a new Elasticsearch similarity index, you need to specify
either the `embeddings` or `model` argument to
`compute_similarity()`. Here’s a few
possibilities:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
model_name = "clip-vit-base32-torch"
model = foz.load_zoo_model(model_name)
brain_key = "elasticsearch_index"

# Option 1: Compute embeddings on the fly from model name
fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model=model_name,
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key=brain_key,
)

# Option 2: Compute embeddings on the fly from model instance
fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model=model,
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key=brain_key,
)

# Option 3: Pass precomputed embeddings as a numpy array
embeddings = dataset.compute_embeddings(model)
fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    embeddings=embeddings,
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key=brain_key,
)

# Option 4: Pass precomputed embeddings by field name
dataset.compute_embeddings(model, embeddings_field="embeddings")
fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    embeddings="embeddings",
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key=brain_key,
)

```

### Create a patch similarity index [¶](\#create-a-patch-similarity-index "Permalink to this headline")

You can also create a similarity index for
[object patches](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-object-similarity) within your dataset by
including the `patches_field` argument to
`compute_similarity()`:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    patches_field="ground_truth",
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    backend="elasticsearch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_patches",
)

```

### Connect to an existing index [¶](\#connect-to-an-existing-index "Permalink to this headline")

If you have already created a Elasticsearch index storing the embedding vectors
for the samples or patches in your dataset, you can connect to it by passing
the `index_name` to
`compute_similarity()`:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",      # zoo model used (if applicable)
    embeddings=False,                   # don't compute embeddings
    index_name="your-index",            # the existing Elasticsearch index
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
)

```

### Add/remove embeddings from an index [¶](\#add-remove-embeddings-from-an-index "Permalink to this headline")

You can use
`add_to_index()`
and
`remove_from_index()`
to add and remove embeddings from an existing Elasticsearch index.

These methods can come in handy if you modify your FiftyOne dataset and need
to update the Elasticsearch index to reflect these changes:

```python
import numpy as np

import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
)
print(elasticsearch_index.total_index_size)  # 200

view = dataset.take(10)
ids = view.values("id")

# Delete 10 samples from a dataset
dataset.delete_samples(view)

# Delete the corresponding vectors from the index
elasticsearch_index.remove_from_index(sample_ids=ids)

# Add 20 samples to a dataset
samples = [fo.Sample(filepath="tmp%d.jpg" % i) for i in range(20)]
sample_ids = dataset.add_samples(samples)

# Add corresponding embeddings to the index
embeddings = np.random.rand(20, 512)
elasticsearch_index.add_to_index(embeddings, sample_ids)

print(elasticsearch_index.total_index_size)  # 210

```

### Retrieve embeddings from an index [¶](\#retrieve-embeddings-from-an-index "Permalink to this headline")

You can use
`get_embeddings()`
to retrieve embeddings from a Elasticsearch index by ID:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
)

# Retrieve embeddings for the entire dataset
ids = dataset.values("id")
embeddings, sample_ids, _ = elasticsearch_index.get_embeddings(sample_ids=ids)
print(embeddings.shape)  # (200, 512)
print(sample_ids.shape)  # (200,)

# Retrieve embeddings for a view
ids = dataset.take(10).values("id")
embeddings, sample_ids, _ = elasticsearch_index.get_embeddings(sample_ids=ids)
print(embeddings.shape)  # (10, 512)
print(sample_ids.shape)  # (10,)

```

### Querying a Elasticsearch index [¶](\#querying-a-elasticsearch-index "Permalink to this headline")

You can query a Elasticsearch index by appending a
[`sort_by_similarity()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.sort_by_similarity")
stage to any dataset or view. The query can be any of the following:

- An ID (sample or patch)

- A query vector of same dimension as the index

- A list of IDs (samples or patches)

- A text prompt (if [supported by the model](../fiftyone_concepts/brain.md#brain-similarity-text))


```python
import numpy as np

import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
)

# Query by vector
query = np.random.rand(512)  # matches the dimension of CLIP embeddings
view = dataset.sort_by_similarity(query, k=10, brain_key="elasticsearch_index")

# Query by sample ID
query = dataset.first().id
view = dataset.sort_by_similarity(query, k=10, brain_key="elasticsearch_index")

# Query by a list of IDs
query = [dataset.first().id, dataset.last().id]
view = dataset.sort_by_similarity(query, k=10, brain_key="elasticsearch_index")

# Query by text prompt
query = "a photo of a dog"
view = dataset.sort_by_similarity(query, k=10, brain_key="elasticsearch_index")

```

Note

Performing a similarity search on a [`DatasetView`](../api/fiftyone.core.view.html#fiftyone.core.view.DatasetView "fiftyone.core.view.DatasetView") will **only** return
results from the view; if the view contains samples that were not included
in the index, they will never be included in the result.

This means that you can index an entire [`Dataset`](../api/fiftyone.core.dataset.html#fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset "fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset") once and then perform
searches on subsets of the dataset by
[constructing views](../fiftyone_concepts/using_views.md#using-views) that contain the images of
interest.

### Accessing the Elasticsearch client [¶](\#accessing-the-elasticsearch-client "Permalink to this headline")

You can use the `client` property of a Elasticsearch index to directly access
the underlying Elasticsearch client instance and use its methods as desired:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
)

elasticsearch_client = elasticsearch_index.client
print(elasticsearch_client)

```

### Advanced usage [¶](\#advanced-usage "Permalink to this headline")

As [previously mentioned](#elasticsearch-config-parameters), you can
customize your Elasticsearch indexes by providing optional parameters to
`compute_similarity()`.

Here’s an example of creating a similarity index backed by a customized
Elasticsearch index. Just for fun, we’ll specify a custom index name, use dot
product similarity, and populate the index for only a subset of our dataset:

```python
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.brain as fob
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")

# Create a custom Elasticsearch index
elasticsearch_index = fob.compute_similarity(
    dataset,
    model="clip-vit-base32-torch",
    embeddings=False,  # we'll add embeddings below
    metric="dotproduct",
    brain_key="elasticsearch_index",
    backend="elasticsearch",
    index_name="custom-quickstart-index",
)

# Add embeddings for a subset of the dataset
view = dataset.take(10)
embeddings, sample_ids, _ = elasticsearch_index.compute_embeddings(view)
elasticsearch_index.add_to_index(embeddings, sample_ids)

```
